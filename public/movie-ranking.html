<h1>Top Three Anime According to the Opinion of the True Fan</h1>
 <h2>Anime top list</h2>
 <hr/>
 <h3>1st Place: Durarara</h3>
 <p>The anime with a lot of plot twists and the incredibly fine writtem characters development that keeps your eyes on the screem for the whole time.</p>
 <p>As a disatvantage i can tell that it is really hard to watch this anime if you do something on a background or combine it with other animes</p>
 <h3>2nd place:Naruto/Naruto Shippuden</h3>
 <p>Literally the iconic and legendary anime that raised generations on itself.
 Beautifull ninja world that contains well-created history, a lot issues current global problems and issues. What the only one phrase costs:</p>
<p>“Those who break the rules are scum,<br/>
 but those who abandon their friends are worse than scum”</p>
 <p>And of course as everything it has got pros and cons. In this case, Naruto has a bunch of necessary fillers that minimally but ruins overall conception of this masterpiece.</p>
 <h3>3rd Place:One Piece</h3>
 <p>Do i even have to tell and describe what is this anime about? In two words...Absolute cinema.The story will tell about the pirate World and the Pirates crew "Mugiwaras" about their adventures on the way of their goal.</p>
<p>The one and only disadvantage is a the slow pace of going sometime one arc has too much series in it so it could be compressed in two times but despite that One Piece is still one of the greatest anime on the Earth.</p>
